# PC Assembly Experience

## What I've Gained

Through the process of assembling a PC, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of the synergy between hardware and software components. This hands-on experience has honed my problem-solving and troubleshooting skills, allowing me to effectively address technical challenges that may arise during assembly. Constructing a PC from the ground up has equipped me with knowledge applicable to future technological advancements. The immersive and practical nature of this course has emphasized the immense value of experiential learning. Not only have I acquired valuable technical skills, but I've also built a robust foundation of knowledge and comprehension, making this course an unforgettable and enriching experience.

## Suggestions for Improvement in the PC Assemble Lab Session

To enhance the PC Assemble Lab, the following improvements are suggested:

- Streamline tasks and reduce assembly times to foster a more efficient and engaging experience for students.
- Incorporate diverse computer configurations with varying assembly constraints, difficulty levels, and unique features to provide students with a range of challenges and learning opportunities.

### Additional Ideas

Explore the possibility of introducing a new challenge:

- Early-completing teams take on an extra project, such as disassembling newer PC sets to analyze differences between old and new models.
  
This not only adds an exciting layer of challenge but also nurtures curiosity and interest in the subject matter.
